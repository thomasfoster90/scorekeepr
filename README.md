##Score Keepr##




<!-- Descriptions -->
There are many games that require tracking scores. Most of us keep track by writing notes in our phones. But what happens when your score is going up and down by big numbers? Switching between the calculator and note apps can become a bit tedious. We came up with the perfect app to track the score of any game you are playing.

##User Stories##
As a Spades player, I don't want to have to look for pen and paper every time I want to play.

As a person who likes to play games, I need to keep track of score for games or rounds where points increment by 1-5 (Ping Pong, Catch Phrase, Tabboo, Bags, Washers, Pool).
